1. ### What are the data types supported by JavaScript?

    * **String** - a series of characters
    * **Boolean** - either true or false
    * **Number** - integers or decimals (no floats or ints like python)
    * **Undefined** - indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all
    * **Null** - the intentional absence of any object value
    * **Object** - a standalone entity, with properties and type
    * **Symbol** - a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive

2. ### What is a primitive data type?

  In JavaScript, a **primitive** is data that is not an object and has no methods.

  The seven primitive data types are:

    * String
    * Number
    * Bigint
    * Boolean
    * Undefined
    * Symbol
    * Null

3. ### What is a callback?

  A function that is to be executed **after** another function has finished executing.

  It is passed to some method as an argument or option.

9. ### What is whitespace and how does it differ from indentation?

Whitespace is any character or series of characters which creates space on a page but does not display a visible mark. Common whitespace characters include tabs and spaces.

Indentation is a type of horizontal whitespace strategically used to enhance the readability of our code. For example, in HTML it is best practice to consistently indent our code to clearly illustrate nestings.

> Think of it as **space around objects**, that helps to delineate the various objects in the document.

In HTML for example, by using nesting levels, the reading and organisation of the code is clearer as you can see where an element begins and ends.
